CodeJAM (born from the initials of our names: Jamie, Angele, Mia) is an app which aims to teach YOU the basics of programming. By signing up in the App with the click of a button you will be provided your very own profile linked to your Hedera wallet which keeps track of your progress and ensures a safe and secure experience on our app. You are then presented with a variety of programming languages to chose from each with their own individual game map where each level is accompanied with a quick lesson on the concept you need to learn for the "test". As you progress through the game, the concepts build on each other and grow more complex to finally reach the goal, which is a real project at the end of all the levels of a language. CodeJAM aims to bring women and other children who may be wary about the STEM field to experience the possibilities of technology and how they can do their part.

How we built it!!

CodeJAM has multiple components which make up its sweet spread:

Xcode and Swift are used for the front end of the app as well as the basic functionalities.
Javascript is used with a Hedera prototype to create user IDs when the user register's with a name on our app.
To connect user data and the app we used Google's Firebase.
Python was used for the main backend of the app such as checking for user input and comparing it with the expected input.
